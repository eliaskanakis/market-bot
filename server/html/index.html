        <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">This is an experimental app that offers an AI assistant providing voice guidance to the user throughout the shopping process.</p>
        <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">The user enters the desired shopping list, and during shopping, the assistant can provide reminders for shopping items based on the user's requests.   
The user can also request modifications to the list, such as removal of specific items.  
For example, let's say the shopping list includes bananas, apples, tomatoes, potatoes, spaghetti, cheese, and milk.   
The user can ask the assistant, "Please tell me the fruits".   
The assistant will respond with "bananas and apples".  
If the user requests, "Please remove the fruits (or the apples)" the assistant will respond by listing the items that have been removed from the shopping list.
